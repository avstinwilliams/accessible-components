				<p>
					Comparison and summary — Google Forms has by far the most accessible design, with more states than Amazon or
					MacOS and more intuitive keyboard controls. MacOS has by far the least, with no hover state or keyboard
					controls. Amazon is somewhere in the middle, and changing from radio button to radio button on their site has
					significant processing time.

				<h2>Part 3: State Models & Redesign</h2>
				<p>
					This section presents the state models of radio buttons for both mouse users and keyboard users, followed by
					an improved redesign.
				</p>

				<h3>Original State Models</h3>

				<h4>Mouse Interaction</h4>

					<img src="./assets/Radio_Button_Mouse_State.png" alt="Initial mouse user state model" />
					<figcaption>Initial mouse user state model</figcaption>
				</figure>

				<h4>Keyboard Interaction</h4>
				<figure>
					<img src="./assets/Radio_Button_Keyboard_State.png" alt="Initial keyboard user state model" />
					<figcaption>Initial keyboard user state model</figcaption>
				</figure>

				<h3>Redesigned State Models</h3>
				<p>Based on issues I identified, the redesigned models introduce:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>An optional deselection button to allow undoing selection by mouse.</li>
					<li>A requirement to press Enter to confirm selection via keyboard.</li>
				</ul>

				<h4>Revised Mouse Interaction</h4>

						src="./assets/REVISED_Radio_Button Mouse_State.png"
						alt="Revised mouse user state model with deselect button"
					/>
					<figcaption>Revised mouse user state model with deselect button</figcaption>
				</figure>

				<h4>Revised Keyboard Interaction</h4>

					<img
						src="./assets/REVISED_Radio_Button Keyboard_State.png"
						alt="Revised keyboard user state model with enter confirmation"
					/>
					<figcaption>Revised keyboard user state model with enter confirmation</figcaption>
				</figure>

				<h3>Redesigned System Preferences</h3>
				<p>Below is a Figma mockup of System Preferences, followed by a redesign based on my revised state models.</p>

				<h4>Initial System Preferences mockup</h4>

					/>

				</figure>

				<p>
					In my redesign, I noticed that once a radio button is selected, users cannot deselect it. It's fairly common
					for someone to accidentally select an option and have no way to undo their choice, so I decided to add a small
					red "x" to the right of the text of the selected radio button. This maintains the efficiency of System
					Preferences' current design, while improving usability. In terms of learnability, 'x' typically represents
					cancellation, and the choice to make it red further enforces that fact. Memorability is not necessary in this
					case, as the x will be present as long as something is selected.
				</p>

			<section id="part4">
				<h2>Part 4: Reflections</h2>

				<ul>
					<li>
						The radio buttons I observed performed well in usability, but accessibility varied. Google Forms provided
						strong keyboard navigation where System Preferences lacked it entirely.
					</li>
					<li>
						My design incorporated an undo selection option to let users deselect a radio button, addressing a missing
						accessibility consideration in real-world applications.
					</li>
					<li>
						Following the social model of disability, my redesign reduces the mismatch between users and the interface
						by making selection more flexible for all users, including those with motor impairments.
					</li>
					<li>
						For example, System Preferences completely lacks support for keyboard users, meaning those who have poor
						motor functions and struggle to use a mouse would run into trouble.
					</li>
					<li>
						Similarly, Google Forms’ lack of explicit selection announcements for screen readers makes it harder for
						visually impaired users to navigate form inputs effectively.
					</li>
					<li>
						Among the different input methods, mouse and touch interactions are commonly prioritized in UI design, which
						creates barriers for users who rely on assistive technologies.
					</li>
