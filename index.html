				<h2>Introduction</h2>
				<p>
					Radio buttons are deceptively simple. Ubiquitous in settings menus, surveys, and checkout flows, they often go
					unnoticed — until they don't work. For users with motor impairments, poor eyesight, or those relying on screen
					readers, even a basic set of choices can become a barrier.
				</p>
				<p>
					I chose to investigate radio buttons across three familiar platforms: Google Forms, MacOS System Preferences,
					and Amazon Checkout, to explore how something so common can vary so much in usability and accessibility. These
					comparisons revealed glaring differences in keyboard support, screen reader output, and visual feedback.
				</p>
				<p>
					While many developers treat radio buttons as an accessibility checkbox, I found that the experience of using
					them (especially without a mouse) was inconsistent and sometimes broken. This case study aims to surface those
					gaps, model state transitions for both mouse and keyboard users, and propose a small redesign that
					meaningfully improves the experience.
				</p>
				<p>
					Designers and developers often assume that basic components “just work.” This case study challenges that
					assumption by asking a simple but powerful question: <em>what happens when they don't?</em>

					Comparison and summary — Google Forms has by far the most accessible design, with more states than Amazon or
					MacOS and more intuitive keyboard controls. MacOS has by far the least, with no hover state or keyboard
					controls. Amazon is somewhere in the middle, and changing from radio button to radio button on their site has
					significant processing time.

				<h2>Part 3: State Models & Redesign</h2>
				<p>
					This section presents the state models of radio buttons for both mouse users and keyboard users, followed by
					an improved redesign.
				</p>

				<h3>Original State Models</h3>

				<h4>Mouse Interaction</h4>

				<h4>Keyboard Interaction</h4>

					<img src="./assets/Radio_Button_Keyboard_State.png" alt="Initial keyboard user state model" />
					<figcaption>Initial keyboard user state model</figcaption>
				</figure>

				<h3>Redesigned State Models</h3>
				<p>Based on issues I identified, the redesigned models introduce:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>An optional deselection button to allow undoing selection by mouse.</li>
					<li>A requirement to press Enter to confirm selection via keyboard.</li>
				</ul>

				<h4>Revised Mouse Interaction</h4>

					<figcaption>Revised mouse user state model with deselect button</figcaption>

				<h4>Revised Keyboard Interaction</h4>

				<h3>Redesigned System Preferences</h3>
				<p>Below is a Figma mockup of System Preferences, followed by a redesign based on my revised state models.</p>

				</figure>

				<p>
					In my redesign, I noticed that once a radio button is selected, users cannot deselect it. It's fairly common
					for someone to accidentally select an option and have no way to undo their choice, so I decided to add a small
					red "x" to the right of the text of the selected radio button. This maintains the efficiency of System
					Preferences' current design, while improving usability. In terms of learnability, 'x' typically represents
					cancellation, and the choice to make it red further enforces that fact. Memorability is not necessary in this
					case, as the x will be present as long as something is selected.
				</p>
			</section>

			<section id="part4">
				<h2>Reflections</h2>
				<p>
					This project reminded me that accessible design is not just about adding labels or supporting keyboard
					navigation — it's about anticipating friction points for real people. Each interface I tested treated radio
					buttons as a solved problem, yet none of them fully supported all users. That gap was most obvious in MacOS,
					where keyboard navigation was absent entirely, and in Google Forms, where screen reader feedback fell short.
				</p>
				<p>
					Proposing a redesign such as adding a deselect button or requiring keyboard confirmation forced me to think
					beyond what's “standard” and instead ask what's intuitive, recoverable, and equitable. For example, allowing a
					user to undo a selection with a simple “X” makes the interface more forgiving, especially for people with
					motor impairments.
				</p>
				<p>
					As designers and developers, we often inherit component libraries or copy familiar UI patterns without
					questioning their accessibility. But inclusive design means interrogating defaults. It means testing with
					screen readers, designing with keyboard-only users in mind, and making even simple interactions resilient to
					error.
				</p>
				<p>
					Small changes in these foundational components can make a meaningful difference. And more importantly, they
					remind us that accessibility isn't an afterthought. It's where good design begins.
